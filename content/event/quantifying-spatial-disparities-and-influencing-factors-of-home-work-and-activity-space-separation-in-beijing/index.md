title: Quantifying spatial disparities and influencing factors of home, work,
  and activity space separation in Beijing
abstract: Due to rapid informatization and increasing urban sprawl, currently,
  metropolitan residents are facing challenges regarding spatial imbalance
  between their home, workplace, and activity locations, which seriously affects
  the quality of life and subjective well-being of urban residents. However,
  only a few existing studies have analyzed the relationship between home,
  workplace, and other activity spaces of urban residents and the influence
  mechanism of spatial separation of the three locations. In this study, we used
  the mobile phone signaling data of the residents of Beijing for May 2019 to
  explore the degree of mutual separation of the three locations, based on the
  identification of the homes, workplaces, and main activity spaces of over 2.3
  million residents in Beijing. Leveraging these data, we discussed the
  influence mechanism of activity separation, in terms of the built environment
  and socioeconomic factors. The results indicated that the degree of the
  home-workplace separation was the highest, followed by the
  home-workplace-activity space separation, and the home-activity space
  separation was the lowest. Notably, the three types of spatial separations had
  significant spatial disparities. Attribution analysis indicated housing price
  as the dominant factor affecting the spatial separation of the residents,
  while the accessibility and location also having important effects. Moreover,
  the interaction of these factors had a stronger explanatory power for the
  spatial separation of the daily activity spaces of the urban residents. This
  study is the first to estimate the degree of spatial separation among the
  homes, workplaces, and other activity spaces of urban residents and analyzed
  their correlation using geographic context factors. Our results can provide
  useful scientific insights to explore the spatial characteristics of the
  home-work-activity relationship with respect to metropolitan residents and
  optimize the spatial distribution of urban functions.
