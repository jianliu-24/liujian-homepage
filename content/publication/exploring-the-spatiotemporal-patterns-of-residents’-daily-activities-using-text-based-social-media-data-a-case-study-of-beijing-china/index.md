abstract: The use of social media data provided powerful data support to reveal
  the spatiotemporal characteristics and mechanisms of human activity, as it
  integrated rich spatiotemporal and textual semantic information. However,
  previous research has not fully utilized its semantic and spatiotemporal
  information, due to its technical and algorithmic limitations. The efficiency
  of the deep mining of textual semantic resources was also low. In this
  research, a multi-classification of text model, based on natural language
  processing technology and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
  Transformers (BERT) framework is constructed. The residents’ activities in
  Beijing were then classified using the Sina Weibo data in 2019. The results
  showed that the accuracy of the classifications was more than 90%. The types
  and distribution of residents’ activities were closely related to the
  characteristics of the activities and holiday arrangements. From the
  perspective of a short timescale, the activity rhythm on weekends was delayed
  by one hour as compared to that on weekdays. There was a significant
  agglomeration of residents’ activities that presented a spatial co-location
  cluster pattern, but the proportion of balanced co-location cluster areas was
  small. The research demonstrated that location conditions, especially the
  microlocation condition (the distance to the nearest subway station), were the
  driving factors that affected the resident activity cluster patterns. In this
  research, the proposed framework integrates textual semantic analysis,
  statistical method, and spatial techniques, broadens the application areas of
  social media data, especially text data, and provides a new paradigm for the
  research of residents’ activities and spatiotemporal behavior.
