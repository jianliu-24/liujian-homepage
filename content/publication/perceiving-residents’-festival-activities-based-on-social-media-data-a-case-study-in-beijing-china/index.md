abstract: " Social media data contains real-time expressed information,
  including text and geographical location. As a new data source for crowd
  behavior research in the era of big data, it can reflect some aspects of the
  behavior of residents. In this study, a text classification model based on the
  BERT and Transformers framework was constructed, which was used to classify
  and extract more than 210,000 residents’ festival activities based on the 1.13
  million Sina Weibo (Chinese “Twitter”) data collected from Beijing in 2019
  data. On this basis, word frequency statistics, part-of-speech analysis, topic
  model, sentiment analysis and other methods were used to perceive different
  types of festival activities and quantitatively analyze the spatial
  differences of different types of festivals. The results show that traditional
  culture significantly influences residents’ festivals, reflecting residents’
  motivation to participate in festivals and how residents participate in
  festivals and express their emotions. There are apparent spatial differences
  among residents in participating in festival activities. The main festival
  activities are distributed in the central area within the Fifth Ring Road in
  Beijing. In contrast, expressing feelings during the festival is mainly
  distributed outside the Fifth Ring Road in Beijing. The research integrates
  natural language processing technology, topic model analysis, spatial
  statistical analysis, and other technologies. It can also broaden the
  application field of social media data, especially text data, which provides a
  new research paradigm for studying residents’ festival activities and adds
  residents’ perception of the festival. The research results provide a basis
  for the design and management of the Chinese festival system."
